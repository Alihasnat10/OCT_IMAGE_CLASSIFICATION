# OCT_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION
# Classification of Diabetic Macular Edema and Dry Age-Related Macular Degeneration from OCT Images with Convolutional Neural Networks
## Problem Statement
To design a system for the identification and classification of OCT Scans of patients suffering from Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) and Diabetic Macular Edema (DME) from
Normal Patients
## OBJECTIVES:
• To develop a classification system that could identify retinal information through OCT
images.
• To identify the disease by scanning images of AMD, DME affected and normal patients.
• The system will be able to classify images at patient level using CNNs.
• To help doctors and experts in identification of maculopathy at early stage in a much
speedy way than previously used CADs.
